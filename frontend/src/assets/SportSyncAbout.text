# About SportSync

## Revolutionizing Sports Participation at NUS

SportSync is an innovative all-in-one platform designed to transform the sports landscape at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Born from the recognition that sports play a pivotal role in student life, we're committed to fostering community engagement, promoting health, and enhancing the overall university experience through technology.

## Our Mission

We aim to **increase sports participation and community engagement at NUS** by creating a centralized platform that makes sports activities more accessible, organized, and connected than ever before.

## The Challenge We're Solving

Despite NUS's vibrant sports culture, we identified several key challenges:

- **Fragmented Communication**: Information about sports events, tournaments, and activities is scattered across multiple platforms, leaving many students unaware of opportunities
- **Limited Visibility**: Smaller sports CCAs struggle to reach potential members beyond occasional fairs
- **Administrative Burden**: Manual processes for attendance tracking and event management consume valuable time that could be spent on actual sports activities
- **Disconnected Community**: Students miss out on supporting their halls and faculties due to lack of accessible information about tournament progress

## Our Solution

SportSync brings together six core features under one unified platform:

### üîê **User Authentication & Profile Management**
Secure access with NUS email authentication and personalized user profiles with emergency contacts and custom profile pictures.

### üèÜ **Open Matchmaking System**
Connect with fellow students for spontaneous games through our lobby-based system. Create, join, and manage sports sessions with real-time capacity tracking and automated notifications.

### üèÖ **CCA Dashboard**
A comprehensive management hub for sports CCAs featuring member management, training session coordination, and automated communication systems.

### üéØ **Tournament Information System**
Enhanced visibility for major tournaments like IHG and IFG with live updates, team management, match tracking, and historical results database.

### üìÖ **Event Creation & Management**
Streamlined organization of special sports events with registration systems, waitlist management, and automated participant communication.

### üõçÔ∏è **Merchandise Shop**
Centralized marketplace for CCA merchandise with integrated wishlist functionality and notification systems for new products.
